UW was a great experience because it allowed me to focus on the REACT framework which quickly became my favorite frontend framework after my MERN stack experience. It was a slower paced bootcamp compared to the hyper fast timeline the Coding Dojo offers. This slower pace really allowed for more exploration into the REACT suite. React, like python, has found a special place in my life.",

The Dojo was an amazing experience, it was intense and made for some long days even though I came into it with some self-learned knowlege. In just three and a half short months, which felt long, we covered Web Fundamentals (2 weeks), Python using the Django framework (4 weeks), MERN which stands for Mongo, Express, React, and Nodejs (4 weeks), and C# with ASP.NET as framework (4 weeks).",
